How to Access - Using GitHub App
================================
These instructions are for the MacOSX client, but they will 
most likely translate relatively easy to windows.

1. Download github app.
    https://mac.github.com
    https://windows.github.com
    
2. Clone repository
    - Select your user name in the left column window
    - Select repo from list of your repositories
    - Select 'Clone'/'Clone to Computer'

3. Syncing
    - With the github app the 'Sync' button does both pushing 
      and pulling simultaneously.
    - Always pull before making changes and pushing

4. Commits
    - Select files that you wish to commit (by default they are 
      all selected)
    - Click 'Commit' to stage changes for pushing.
    - Commits are not synced with repo until you press 'Sync'

5. Creating a Branch
    - By default everything is on the master branch
    - If you are going to make some changes that may take some 
      time or implimenting a specific feature, then create a new 
      branch.
    - Do this by selecting 'Branches' from the left column.
    - Then select the '+' next to the branch you wish to break from
    - Creating a branch copies all the existing commits in that branch
      into the new one. Commits to each branch will remain seperate 
      until they are merged again.

How to Access - Using Command Line
==================================

The tutorials on GitHub do a much better job of explaining things then I do. Here are the links:

Mac:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac

Windows:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows

Linux:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux

You may need to become familiar with using github command line to manage things like merges and such.
